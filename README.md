# RuffLife iOS

Created for the HackHarvard Fall 2017 hackathon, this iOS app utilizes Microsoft Cognitive Custom Vision Service API, Amazon AWS DynamoDB, Amazon AWS S3 to recognize and extract information from the images taken of lost cats and dogs. It provides a simple and intuitive lost-and-found platform for owners to search for their lost pets via location services, as well as for people who have discovered lost pets to add to our database with the help of image recognition.
